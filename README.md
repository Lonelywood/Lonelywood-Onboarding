## This library is under development. I do not recommend using it in professional projects at its current state.

## What is this?
Lonelywood.Onboarding is Xamarin.Android library for **fast** implementation of **beautiful** onboarding screens.

You have only one chance to make a **first impression**, so you should concentrate on creating perfect and captivating onboarding screens, instead of coding all of UI yourself. This library does the boring work for you by providing an **easy-to-use** and **configurable** horizontal pager UI for your onboarding experience.
